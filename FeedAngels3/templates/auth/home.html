                                Food waste has increased significantly. According to the Food and
                                Agriculture Organization, 1/3 of all food produced for human use
                                is thrown away, amounting to over 1.3 billion tons each year. On
                                the other hand, according to the WHO, 20% of the population is
                                facing severe food shortages. As a result, a solution that avoids
                                food waste while also feeding the hungry is required.
